# hashmap-left-join

+ Code Challenges 33

## Challenge

Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

## Approach & Efficiency

I took the approach of minimizing big O space/time by keeping my functions simplistic and focused on only what was necessary to complete the task.
I add a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
