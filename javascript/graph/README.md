# hashmap-left-join

+ Code Challenges 35

## Challenge

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

- add node

- add edge

- Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph

- get nodes

- get neighbors

- size

## Approach & Efficiency

I took the approach of minimizing big O space/time by keeping my functions simplistic and focused on only what was necessary to complete the task.
I add a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
