# Hashtables

+ Code Challenges 30

## Challenge

Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

- add
- get
- contains
- hash

## Approach & Efficiency

I took the approach of minimizing big O space/time by keeping my functions simplistic and focused on only what was necessary to complete the task.
I add a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
